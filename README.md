# KonaMirr

A modern Konachan mirror site.

This site is still under **heavy** construction. Please come back later if you'd 
like to see how it performs.

## Roadmap

### Finished Features

- Display pictures in Waterfall flow (aka Marsonry)
- Display a single picture and its descriptions (tags, uploader, download link, 
  comments, etc.)
- Search for pictures using query

### WIP Features

- A **usable** search bar 
- Not reloading the image flow when viewing single images (image viewer overlay 
  or something similar)
- Format comments

### Planned Features (priority)

- Categorize tags (*characters, authors, original works, and regular tags*) (+5)
- Switching between *safe (G) mode* and *unsafe (R-18) mode* (currently only 
  safe mode) (+5)
- Logging in (+3)
- Uploading, managing and commenting on pictures, tags and wikis (0)
- Posting in forum (-5)
- anything else that can be done in Moebooru (-10)
- *adaptation to other sites (Yandere, Danbooru, ...)* (-10)

## Usage

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

## Requirements

For now, to display the webpage properly, you need to install **Product Sans** 
and **Roboto** fonts in your computer.
